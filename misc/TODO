Tapestry cards
  “Tyranny” had a series of glitches—it wouldn’t let the player play a card on top of it, and it prevented the game from continuing due to reasons we didn’t completely understand (something related to the income turn after an era in which Tyranny was active.
  “Olympic Host” should given the person who plays it the first choice, but it didn’t FIXED

  “Vaccine” should give you the option to advance or not advance, and it shouldn’t provide a benefit/bonus. However, in the game it didn’t give a choice, and it provided the benefit and bonus.
UI
  I like that the board can rotate, but it frequently rotated without me asking it to. I couldn’t pinpoint why or when this was happening—it seemed to be random.
  Because the names on the advancement and income tracks are sometimes important to read, I would suggest adding place on each track where you can hover your mouse in such a way that the entire track will appear zoomed into the foreground.
  Even though the landmark track is available on the screen, I think it would help if players could hover over a landmark icon on an advancement track or tech card and see the landmark size (the number of plots it will cover). Also, in Plans & Ploys we add little tokens that are placed on the board during setup to show landmarks that have or haven’t been gained yet. It might be worth adding those tokens to the core game on BGA.
  There were some glitches around placing buildings in capital cities that refreshing seemed to help. I’d also recommend adding an indicator for landmark placement that shows clearly that the highlighted plots are the eligible upper left plots for the landmarks (it’s a clever solution—it just needs to be communicated to the player).
  It would be helpful to see in other players’ tableaus (near their income mats) if they have tapestry cards in hand and how many. They would be face down. This information is in the upper right of the screen, but pretty much everything else is tracked in their tableaus, so it would be helpful for the tapestry cards to appear there too.
Little things
  In our 4-player game (username “jameystegmaier” in case you need to look it up), even though my neighbor passed into a new era first, I still received the first-to-pass bonus. We thought maybe this was due to the missing fifth player between us on the map, but that player should be ignored whenever looking at neighbors. FIXED
  In the scrolling sidebar, the word “adjustments” is misspelled in reference to civ adjustments. FIXED
  In certain orientations of the board, the starting outposts appeared to stack on top of each other instead of next to each other. FIXED
  In the text explaining science die benefits, I think “benefit” was misspelled. FIXED



Questions for Jamey (orig dev):
    1. If you gain a new Civ during 1st step of income turn (e.g. Inventors upgrade radio to square) can you use that civ ability straight away (e.g. if one of the ‘income turn’ abilities…?).  Was answered here (Inventors + Radio technology during the first step of the income | BoardGameGeek) as ‘B’ which I think means you are okay to use it’s ability…? For now, not coded.
    2. Nomadic structures. 
        a. Can you conquer adjacent to these? Assumed yes.
        b. Can you play a trap card if a player tries to conquer these? Assumed yes.
        c. If you are conquering a nomadic structure, does this count as a topple? Assumed yes.
    3. Age of Discovery vs Broker of Peace, Theocracy, Dictatorship?
    4. Discarding tech cards bonus: can you discard a tech card if there is an inventor token on it?
    5. Socialism: if you already match an opponent on a track can you move the token? Assumed no.
    6. Dark Ages: Is the intention here to advance one token 3 places and the other three regress if possible? (I ask as the AI Singularity could have moved a token so one track is doubled up which then makes the wording of this card very difficult to interpret as not all 4 ‘tracks’ will be in play). Assuming for now it’s essentially the tokens.
